- title: "Get on the BAND Wagon: A Bayesian Framework for Quantifying Model Uncertainties in Nuclear Dynamics"
  image: flowchart_tikz_paper_truncated.png
  description: >
    We describe the Bayesian Analysis of Nuclear Dynamics (BAND) framework, 
    a cyberinfrastructure that we are developing which will unify the treatment of nuclear models, 
    experimental data, and associated uncertainties. 
    We overview the statistical principles and nuclear-physics contexts underlying the BAND toolset,
    with an emphasis on Bayesian methodology's ability to leverage insight from multiple models. 
    In order to facilitate understanding of these tools we provide a simple and accessible example of the BAND framework's application. 
    Four case studies are presented to highlight how elements of the framework will enable progress on complex, far-ranging problems in nuclear physics. 
    By collecting notation and terminology, providing illustrative examples, and giving an overview of the associated techniques, 
    this paper aims to open paths through which the nuclear physics and statistics communities can contribute to and build upon the BAND framework.

- title: "Machine-Learning-Based Inversion of Nuclear Responses"
  image: bestworstresponse6.png
  description: >
    A microscopic description of the interaction of atomic nuclei with external electroweak probes is required for elucidating 
    aspects of short-range nuclear dynamics and for the correct interpretation of neutrino oscillation experiments. Nuclear 
    quantum Monte Carlo methods infer the nuclear electroweak response functions from their Laplace transforms. Inverting the 
    Laplace transform is a notoriously ill-posed problem; and Bayesian techniques, such as maximum entropy, are typically used 
    to reconstruct the original response functions in the quasielastic region. In this work, we present a physics-informed 
    artificial neural network architecture suitable for approximating the inverse of the Laplace transform. Utilizing simulated, 
    albeit realistic, electromagnetic response functions, we show that this physics-informed artificial neural network outperforms 
    maximum entropy in both the low-energy transfer and the quasielastic regions, thereby allowing for robust calculations of 
    electron scattering and neutrino scattering on nuclei and inclusive muon capture rates.

  image: np_tot_cs_werr_SMS_n4lo_plus_Lambda450MeV.png
  description: >
    We combine Newton's variational method with ideas from eigenvector continuation to construct a fast & accurate emulator 
    for two-body scattering observables. The emulator will facilitate the application of rigorous statistical methods for 
    interactions that depend smoothly on a set of free parameters. 
    When used to emulate the neutron-proton cross section with a modern chiral interaction as a function of 26 free parameters, 
    it reproduces the exact calculation with negligible error and provides an over 300x improvement in CPU time.

    Eigenvector continuation (EC), which accurately and efficiently reproduces ground states 
    for targeted sets of Hamiltonian parameters, is extended to scattering using the Kohn 
    variational principle. Proofs-of-principle imply EC will be a valuable emulator for 
    applying Bayesian inference to parameter estimation constrained by scattering observables.

  description: >
      We assess the accuracy of Bayesian polynomial extrapolations from small parameter values
      to large ones. We employ Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to combine results from different order polynomials. 
      Our study considers two "toy problems" where the underlying function used to generate data sets is known. 
      We use Bayesian parameter estimation to extract the polynomial coefficients and BMA different polynomial degrees 
      by weighting each according to its Bayesian evidence. We compare the predictive performance of this Bayesian Model Average
      with that of the individual polynomials.

- title: "Toward emulating nuclear reactions using eigenvector continuation"
  image: TowardsEmulating.png
  description: >
      We construct an efficient emulator for two-body scattering observables using the general (complex) Kohn 
      variational principle and trial wave functions derived from eigenvector continuation. The emulator simultaneously 
      evaluates an array of Kohn variational principles associated with different boundary conditions, which allows for the detection 
      and removal of spurious singularities known as Kohn anomalies. When applied to the K-matrix only, our emulator resembles the one constructed 
      by Furnstahl et al. (2020) although with reduced numerical noise. After a few applications to real potentials, we emulate differential 
      cross sections for 40Ca(n,n) scattering based on a realistic optical potential and quantify the model uncertainties using Bayesian methods. These 
      calculations serve as a proof of principle for future studies aimed at improving optical models.

- title: "Precision measurement of lightweight self-conjugate nucleus 80Zr"
  image: 80ZrBMAEDFs.png
  description: >
        Protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus move in shells analogous to the electronic shell structures of atoms. 
        The nuclear shell structure varies as a result of changes in the nuclear mean field with the number of neutrons N 
        and protons Z, and these variations can be probed by measuring the mass differences between nuclei. The N = Z = 40 
        self-conjugate nucleus 80Zr is of particular interest, as its proton and neutron shell structures are expected to 
        be very similar, and its ground state is highly deformed. Here we provide evidence for the existence of a deformed 
        double-shell closure in 80Zr through high-precision Penning trap mass measurements of 80–83Zr. Our mass values show 
        that 80Zr is substantially lighter, and thus more strongly bound than predicted. This can be attributed to the 
        deformed shell closure at N = Z = 40 and the large Wigner energy. A statistical Bayesian-model mixing analysis 
        employing several global nuclear mass models demonstrates difficulties with reproducing the observed mass anomaly 
        using current theory.

- title: "Rigorous constraints on three-nucleon forces in chiral effective field theory from fast and accurate calculations of few-body observables"
  image: Qcbarposterior.png
  description: >
         We explore the constraints on the three-nucleon force (3NF) of chiral effective field theory (ChiEFT)
         that are provided by bound-state observables in the A=3 and A=4 sectors. Our statistically rigorous 
         analysis incorporates experimental error, computational method uncertainty, and the uncertainty due to 
         truncation of the ChiEFT expansion at next-to-next-to-leading order. A consistent solution for the 
         3H binding energy, the 4He binding energy and radius, and the 3H beta-decay rate can only be obtained if 
         ChiEFT truncation errors are included in the analysis. The beta-decay rate is the only one of these that 
         yields a nondegenerate constraint on the 3NF low-energy constants, which makes it crucial for the parameter 
         estimation. We use eigenvector continuation for fast and accurate emulation of no-core shell model 
         calculations of the few-nucleon observables. This facilitates sampling of the posterior probability 
         distribution, allowing us to also determine the distributions of the parameters that quantify the truncation error. 
         We find a ChiEFT expansion parameter of Q=0.33 ± 0.06 for these observables.

- title: "Statistical tools for a better optical model"
  image: 48CaSensitivities.png
  description: >
         Modern statistical tools provide the ability to compare the information content of observables and 
         provide a path to explore which experiments would be most useful to give insight into and constrain theoretical models.
         In this work we study three such tools, (i) the principal component analysis, (ii) the sensitivity analysis based on derivatives, 
         and (iii) the Bayesian evidence. This is done in the context of nuclear reactions with the goal of constraining the optical potential.
         We first apply these tools to a toy-model case. Then we consider two different reaction observables, elastic angular distributions
         and polarization data for reactions on 48Ca and 208Pb at two different beam energies. For the toy-model case, we find significant 
         discrimination power in the sensitivities and the Bayesian evidence, showing clearly that the volume imaginary term is more useful 
         to describe scattering at higher energies. When comparing between elastic cross sections and polarization data using realistic optical 
         models, sensitivity studies indicate that both observables are roughly equally sensitive but the variability of the optical model 
         parameters is strongly angle dependent. The Bayesian evidence shows some variability between the two observables, but the Bayes factor 
         obtained is not sufficient to discriminate between angular distributions and polarization.

- title: "Efficient emulation of relativistic heavy ion collisions with transfer learning"
  image: cpu_hours.png
  description: >
         Measurements from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) can be used to study the properties
         of quark-gluon plasma. Systematic constraints on these properties must combine measurements from different collision systems and methodically 
         account for experimental and theoretical uncertainties. Such studies require a vast number of costly numerical simulations. While computationally 
         inexpensive surrogate models ("emulators") can be used to efficiently approximate the predictions of heavy ion simulations across a broad range of
         model parameters, training a reliable emulator remains a computationally expensive task. We use transfer learning to map the parameter dependencies
         of one model emulator onto another, leveraging similarities between different simulations of heavy ion collisions. By limiting the need for large 
         numbers of simulations to only one of the emulators, this technique reduces the numerical cost of comprehensive uncertainty quantification when 
         studying multiple collision systems and exploring different models.
